# Nuno's archive redirector

This is a Chrome extension that redirects pages to their saved version on archive.org / archive.ph. It is useful to view past versions of pages, but also to view pages accessible to crawlers but not to normal users.

## Built with

- [Hello world extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world)
- Archive.org
- Archive.is 
- google-bot-view.nunosempere.com
- [Flat Icon]("https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/redirect")

## How to install

### From the Chrome web store

You can now download this extension from the [Chrome web store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/nunos-archive-redirector/dlngooffngfcnconkjnhogjanbcoaibf).

### From source

Download this repository as a folder with:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:NunoSempere/archive-redirector.git
```

Go to chrome://extensions and click "load unpacked". By design, chrome://extensions is not linkable. In brave, go to brave://extensions. Load this extension. 

If you want to get an updated version, navigate to your previous folder 

```sh
git pull origin master
```

Then go to chrome://extensions (respectively brave://extensions) and reload the extension.


### Assign a shortcut

You can assign a shortcut to this extension with:

- chrome://extensions/shortcuts in Chrome
- brave://extensions/shortcuts in Brave

For instance, I assigned Ctrl+P
