# Archive redirector

This is a Chrome extension that redirects pages to their saved version on archive.ph. It is based on [this extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/archivetoday-automator/mmhadhnchpgicjlmlcdfaapkekknnkha?hl=en-US), which redirects to an older domain. It is useful to view past versions of pages, but also to view pages accessible to crawlers but not to normal users.
